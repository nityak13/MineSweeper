  "body": "#Minesweeper\r\nThis project encompasses all the usual rules of the traditional minesweeper game. \r\nUsers can customize their own board with the height, width and number of mines, entered as command line arguments.\r\nUsers uncover a particular spot based on the coordinates specified.\r\n\r\nThe key functions-\r\n* Generated the board with user specified height,width and number of bombs to play the game.\r\n* Randomized the location of bombs using mt19937 (Mersenne Twister) algorithm.\r\n* Built the logic around uncovering the bombs.\r\n* Allow flagging of suspected bombs and ensure that these don't get clicked/uncovered.\r\n\r\nFrom a secure coding perspective-\r\n* Care was taken to allocate and deallocate the memory for representing the board.\r\n* Used a better randomization function as compared to the usual rand().\r\n* Ensured the only valid inputs were accepted form the user.\r\n* All unexpected conditions were caught and handled appropriately.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
