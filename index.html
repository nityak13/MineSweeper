      <p>This project encompasses all the usual rules of the traditional minesweeper game. 
Users can customize their own board with the height, width and number of mines, entered as command line arguments.
Users uncover a particular spot based on the coordinates specified.</p>

<p>The key functions-</p>

<ul>
<li>Generated the board with user specified height,width and number of bombs to play the game.</li>
<li>Randomized the location of bombs using mt19937 (Mersenne Twister) algorithm.</li>
<li>Built the logic around uncovering the bombs.</li>
<li>Allowed flagging of suspected bombs and ensure that these don't get clicked/uncovered.</li>
</ul>

<p>From a secure coding perspective care was taken to apply the rules and recommendations for Arrays and Expressions as per the SEI CERT Coding Standards. 
Some of the applications are-</p>

<ul>
<li>Care was taken to allocate and deallocate the memory for representing the board and not reading into uninitialized memory.</li>
<li>Ensuring proper size arguments for variable length arrays.</li>
<li>Explicit testing to determine success, true, false and equality using if else loops.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a RED team we evaluated the opponent's code base for declarations, initialization and other Miscellaneous standards.
Some of the evaluation points were-</p>

<ul>
<li>Used a better randomization function as compared to the usual rand().</li>
<li>Ensured the only valid inputs were accepted form the user.</li>
<li>All unexpected conditions were caught and handled appropriately.</li>
</ul>
